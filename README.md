Description -
Cohort Sort is meant to be a project management app that allows a user to create project boards and add both lists and tasks to each board. Additional functionality includes inviting other users to add on to a board/task/list to allow for group project boards.

Technologies Used -
Cohort Sort was built using HTML, CSS, and Angular. The app also uses AngularJS to make AJAX-like calls to a database.

Approach -
Most of the site was created while utilizing paired coding. It wasn't until the bulk of the functionality was in place that we ended up splitting off for various tasks like building the CSS, finishing up routes, or doing some code cleanup. Challenges we came across were mainly to do with adding additional users to boards and moving tasks to different lists (ie: To Do, Doing, Done). These issues were solved with quite a bit of trial and error and occasional help from TA's and teachers.
